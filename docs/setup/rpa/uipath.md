## Step 1 — Visit the UiPath Website

Go to [uipath.com](https://www.uipath.com/) to access the UiPath homepage.

## Step 2 — Sign Up for a Free Account

## Step 3 — Choose the Right Account Type

:::warning
If you are signing up with a **personal email** (e.g. Gmail, Outlook), do **not** fill in the work email form. Instead, scroll down and click **"Get Automation Cloud for community"** to sign up for the free Community edition.

Enter your **work or personal email address** and click **"Create Account"**.

You can also sign up quickly using **Continue with Google** or **Continue with Microsoft** instead of entering your email manually.

## Step 6 — Name Your Cloud Organization

Enter any name you like in the **Cloud Organization Name** field, then click **"Create Organization"**.

:::info
This is just the name of your personal UiPath workspace — it has nothing to do with the company or organization you work for. You can name it anything, e.g. `test123`.
